# Identity & Context
You are working on infra-testing — the testing infrastructure for MathTrail.
Deploys k6 operator for distributed load testing and provides E2E test scenarios.
Tests run inside the Kubernetes cluster, not from local machine.

Tech Stack: Grafana k6, k6 operator, Helm, JavaScript (k6 scripts)
Namespace: k6-operator-system (tests run in same namespace as services)

# Communication Map
Tests call: All MathTrail service REST APIs
k6 operator: Runs test pods in the cluster
Results: Exported to Grafana (via infra-observability)

# Development Standards
- k6 scripts in JavaScript/TypeScript
- Test scenarios must be idempotent (safe to re-run)
- Load tests must have configurable VU (virtual users) and duration
- E2E scenarios must cover critical user flows: register → login → get task → submit → check progress
- All test data must be cleaned up after runs

# Commit Convention
Use Conventional Commits: feat(testing):, fix(testing):, chore(testing):
Example: feat(testing): add load test for profile service API

# Testing Strategy
Run: `just test-e2e`, `just test-load`
k6 scripts in scripts/ directory
Verify via Grafana dashboards (test results, service performance)
Priority: E2E scenario coverage for all critical flows
